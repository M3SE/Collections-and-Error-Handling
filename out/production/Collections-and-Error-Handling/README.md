# Collections-and-Error-Handling

## Task
Create a Java program that works with a predefined list of integers, performs some operations on a collection, and handles exceptions that might occur during the process.

1. Define a List of integers with at least one set of duplicates.
2. Use a Set to remove duplicates.
3. Calculate the sum and average of the integers.
4. Print the sum, average, and the list of integers without duplicates.
5. Handle exceptions, such as IndexOutOfBoundsException, IllegalArgumentException, and ArithmeticException.
6. Use try-catch-finally and multi-catch blocks as needed.
